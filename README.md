From a business perspective, we are tasked with identifying key drivers for used car prices.  In the CRISP-DM overview, we are asked to convert this business framing to a data problem definition.  Using a few sentences, reframe the task as a data task with the appropriate technical vocabulary. 

##### Understanding the Business Context

Understanding the business context is essential in determining the factors that drive used car prices. Knowing these significant attributes assists dealerships in making informed inventory choices as well as support sales teams in creating competitive pricing schemes. Knowing market trends also helps businesses in prioritizing vehicles that are in high demand and maximizing sales efforts.
