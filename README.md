UC Berkeley AI/ML Course Assignment: What Drives the Price of a Car?

## Business Understanding

From a business perspective, we are tasked with identifying key drivers for used car prices.  In the CRISP-DM overview, we are asked to convert this business framing to a data problem definition.  Using a few sentences, reframe the task as a data task with the appropriate technical vocabulary. 

##### Understanding the Business Context

Understanding the business context is essential in determining the factors that drive used car prices. Knowing these significant attributes assists dealerships in making informed inventory choices as well as support sales teams in creating competitive pricing schemes. Knowing market trends also helps businesses in prioritizing vehicles that are in high demand and maximizing sales efforts. 

##### Defining Success

The study seeks to reveal the most significant determinants of automobile prices, providing practical guidance for pricing strategy and inventory management. With this information in hand, dealers are able to make more informed decisions that maximize profitability while being competitive in the marketplace.

Despite the massive car listings in the dataset, data preprocessing would need to be done to address missing values and outliers. This is crucial to ensure accuracy and reliability even if this would mean having a reduced sample size for developing the model.

## Data Understanding

One of the first visualizations was to determine the distribution of car manufacturers in the dataset. The countplot below shows the most frequent manufacturers by number of records in the dataset. It provides an overview of most represented manufacturers in the dataset, which can potentially provide information on trends and availability of various brands of cars in various regions.
